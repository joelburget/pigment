How to read me:
    '<-'  means "because"
    '->'  means "therefore"
    '/>'  means "but"

The spatial tabbing encodes the scope. Things on the same column are
linked by an implicit "and". Things under an argument justify it.

I know, that's fucked up and you hate it. But that's much better to
read that crap than reading my long frenglish sentences a la James
Proust.

\section{The Type Theory}

\subsection{Base theory}

\begin{structure}
<- Presentation of the formalism
    <- Standard presentation
        -> No novelty here
    <- 3 judgments [equation]
        -> Context validity
        -> Typing judgements
        -> Equality judgements
    <- Invariants [equation]
        -> By induction on derivations
    <- Judgemental equality
        <- Presentation independant of particular implementation choice
        -> Model in Agda, intensional
        -> Used in Epigram, OTT
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Context validity [figure]
    <- Not much to be said
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Typing judgements [figure]
    <- Set in Set
        -> For simplicity of presentation
        -> Assume that a valid stratification can be inferred
            <- Harper-Pollack, Luo, Courant
        -> See later discussion
    <- Standard presentation of Pi and Sigma types
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Judgemental equality [figure]
    <- symmetry, reflexivity, and transitivity
    <- beta-rules for lambda and pair
    <- xi-rule for functions
    -> Agnostic in the notion of equality
        <- Doesn't rely on a ``propositional'' equality
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
!!! Need Help !!!
<- Meta-theoretical properties
    <- Assuming a stratified discipline
    <> The point here is to reassert that dependent types are not evil, 
       there is no non-terminating type-checker, or such horrible lies <>
    -> Strongly normalizing
        -> Every program terminates
    -> Type-checking terminates
    ???
\end{structure}

\subsection{Finite sets}

\begin{structure}
<- Motivation
    <- Finite sets could be encoded with Unit and Bool
        /> Hinder the ability to name things
    -> For convenience
        <- Named elements
        <- Referring by name instead of code
        -> Types as coding presentation
            /> Also as coding representation!
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Implementation [figure]      
    <- Tags
        -> Purely informational token
    <- EnumU
        -> Universe of finite sets
    <- EnumT e
        -> Elements of finite set e
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Equipment
    <- \spi operator
        <- Equivalent of Pi on finite sets
        <- First argument: (finite) domain
        <- Second argument: for each element of the domain, a co-domain
        -> Inhabitant of \spi: right-nested tuple of solutions
            <- Skip code for space reasons
    <- switch operator
        <- case analyses over x
        <- index into the \spi tuple to retrieve the corresponding result
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Equivalent to having a function space over finite sets
    /> Made non-obvious by low-level encodings
        <- General issue with codes
             -> Need to provide an attractive presentation to the user
    -> Types seem to obfuscate our reading
        <- Provide ``too much'' information
        /> False impression: information is actually waiting to be used more widely
        -> See next Section
\end{structure}

\subsection{Type propagation}

\begin{structure}
<- Bidirectional type-checking [ref. Turner,Pierce]
    -> Separating type-checking from type synthesis
    <- Type checking: push terms into types
        <- Example: |Pi S T :>: \ x . t| allows us to drop annotation on lambda
    <- Type inference: pull types out of terms
        <- Example: |x : S l- x :<: S| gives us the type of x
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Formalization: type propagation
    <- Motivation
        -> High-level syntax
            -> exprIn: types are pushed in
                <- Subject to type *checking*
            -> exprEx: types are pulled from
                <- Subject to type *synthesis*
        -> Translated into our low-level type theory
        -> Presented as judgements
    -> Presentation mirors typing rule of [figure] 
        -> Ignore identitical judgements
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Type checking [figure]
    <- Push a type in an exprIn
    <- Result in a full term
    -> *Use* the type to build the term!
        -> Domain and co-domain propagation for Pi and Sigma
        -> Translation of 'tags into EnumTs
        -> Translation of ['tags ...] into EnumUs
        -> Finite function space into switch
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Type synthesis [figure]
    <- Pull a type out of an exprEx
    <- Result in a full term, together with its type
    -> Do *not* need to specify types
        -> Extracting a term from the context
        -> Function application
        -> Projections
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Summary
    -> Not a novel technique [refs?]
        /> Used as a boilerplate scrapper
    -> Make dealing with codes *practical*
        <- Example: Finite sets/finite function space
        -> We should not restrain ourself in using codes
            <- We know how to present them to the user
-> Will extend this machinery in further sections
\end{structure}

    /> Need ability to manipulate these sigmas
        -> Define a Code for data-types

\end{structure}

\subsection{A universe of descriptions}

\begin{structure}
<- Introduction to Universe construction
    <- Define a Code
        -> Name objects

\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Justification of the code

<- Recall typing rules of 1st section
    -> Make clear they were just promises

        <- Simply List UId
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}

    -> Type theory doesn't need to be extended with EnumU, NilE, and ConsE
        <- EnumU == Mu EnumUD
        <- NilE, ConsE are just tags
    -> Do not need a specific \spi eliminator
        <- \spi is an instance of the generic eliminator
            <- Code?
    -> Anything else remains the same (switch, EnumT, 0, 1+)
\end{structure}

\begin{structure}
<- Summary of the operation
    <- The content of the type theory is exactly the same
        <- before == after
    /> type naming scheme condenses

    -> Our next step is a similar move (in essence)
        /> Condenses the entire naming scheme of data-types
\end{structure}

\subsection{Implementing descriptions}

\begin{structure}
<- Realizing our promises
    <- We are going to implement Desc
    /> Desc is itself a data-type
        <- Same situation as EnumU
            <- We want to benefit from generic operations
        -> It ought to be encoded in itself
\end{structure}

\subsubsection{First try}

\begin{structure}
<- A partial implementation
    <- '1 and 'indx are easy
    <- 'sigma is partially doable
        /> lack the ability to do an higher-order inductive call
    -> Show partial code [figure]

\end{structure}

\subsubsection{Desc, atomically}

\begin{structure}
<- Adding hindx have introduced some duplication
    <- indx == hindx 1
    -> We can factor out commonalities 
        /> Obtain an equivalent presentation
