* Open Questions
** TODO How could we get Hutton expressions with different type of variables?
** TODO Better transition for IDesc
** TODO coding/encoding distinction sufficiently clear?
* Post-doc area
** TODO Code review of the Agda models

*** Desc.agda
*** IDesc.agda
*** (IDesc_type_in_type.agda)

If it hasn't been translated into universe polymorphism

* Janitor service
** TODO Parenthesize \mu or not
** TODO Find a convenient name for Hutton's razor

And replace occurences of "Typed expressions"

* Dones
** DONE Introduction
** DONE Tagged description needs to go through \toDesc{} before use
** DONE Fix substitution for Hutton expressions

It should use the pieces we have developped, such as discharge.

** DONE Present Fin as a more data-like maneer, or free monad in a more sequent-like maneer

When defining the free monad data-type, I used an Haskell-ish "data"
definition with constructors. When defining the Fin data-type, I used
a sequent presentation of it. I should uniformize this presentation,
and choose one or the other.

** DONE {ExprD_{Free}}_Ty might be a bit to much

It's un-readable. Probably one should be an exponent.

** DONE Quotes on sum-of-product, or not, or maybe. Same for sigmas-of-sigmas
** DONE Finite set declaration: should be EnumT [a, b, c]
** DONE Cool down the many "intuitively"
** DONE composed by/composed of
** DONE Mention convention \Val{} + \Var{dom}{} is point-wise
** DONE Sort out indexing of HExprFreeD
** DONE Uniformize spacing in array @{\:()\:\:}
** DONE "bind" and "return" is not a nice way of writing 
** DONE bi-directional or bidirectional?
** DONE Fig.~\ref or Fig.\ref?
** DONE Discuss stratification
** DONE No indexed fixed-point? 

The IMu type former and iinduction operator are absolutely not presented.

** DONE Conclusion
** DONE Present Fin as tagged constructor?

No. It is too verbose. I just mention it could be done.

** DONE Mention that the notation for lists in the LISP one
** DONE Induction should refer to Benke et al.
** DONE Mention that Desc does not aim at Generic Haskell encoding

Man, we are in a more serious business. Desc is just to help poor
people to grasp the following.

** DONE Use the word "pattern functor" which seems to be used
** DONE Find references for usage of bidirectional type-checking
** DONE Find references of universe construction in functional programming

*** Norell's xml?
*** Nisse's parser?
*** ???
** DONE I have written "user" here and there.

This might not be the tone of the paper. We probaly want to call "user" a developer.

** DONE No-argument version of multi-argument things, to avoid empty spaces
** DONE Fix replace code
** DONE Fix explanation of elaboration of constructors
** DONE Fix comparison with Generic Haskell

"You say that your approach also supports the Generic Haskell model of
generic programming. One of the nice things of GH is that it works
fine for datatypes with higher-kinded parameters (say data Rose f a =
Leaf a | Branch (f (Rose f a))). I do not see how your framework could
deal with that. Also, you do not explore the concept of generic views,
which are present in GH."

** DONE Fix comparison with SYB

"The comparison with SYB puzzles me, as I saw almost nothing in your
work that I could find similar to SYB. SYB has an underlying Spine
view, whereas you use a sum of products. Also, generic functions in
SYB are defined using combinators, whereas with your style they are
defined by induction in the structure of types. SYB relies on run-time
type comparison, and is not exploiting the functorial structure of
types (so it's unable to define 'cata', for instance). So I don't
really see many similarities..."

** DONE Say something about arity generic stuff?
** DONE Explain that \overbar turns a tagged description into a description
** DONE We might want 5.3.1 Tagged Indexed Descriptions to be just an Example paragraph
** DONE Fix mentions of strictly positive types

There is a \note about it somewhere.

** DONE cataI is not defined
** DONE No indexed induction principle discussion?

iinduction operator is absolutely not presented.

** DONE The comma in Pi/Sigma typing rule seems confusing
** DONE Better names for subcomponents of tagged indexed description

\newcommand{\ATagIDesc}[1]{\F{ATagIDesc}~#1}
\newcommand{\ITagIDesc}[1]{\F{ITagIDesc}~#1}

Just stinks, says nothing useful.

** DONE Type presentation / representation is just confusing me

Finite set motivation stinks. I should sit down with Conor and find a
clear motivation for it. This will also impact on the motivation for a
universe of descriptions.

** DONE Simply-typed Haskell??

Man everybody knows that Haskell is the first mainstream
dependently-typed language. So, how do I get arround my various
"simply-typed languages, such as Haskell"?

** DONE Improve finite sets motivation (encoding vs. codes)

Section sec:finite-sets

** DONE Improve motivation for the use of codes for inductive types

Pedagogically answer the question:
"Why using codes instead of raw sigmas?"

Section sec:desc-universe

** DONE Improve motivation of dependent-types

Talk about decidability, termination, etc.

** DONE induction-recursion? induction recursion

'induction-recursion'


** DONE s/data*type/datatype/
** DONE Remove mention of tech report

Implement induction.

** DONE Discuss induction/recursion
** DONE Improve motivation and high-level picture of indexing

Section sec:indexing-desc

** DONE Shall we present EnumU with tags as constructors, directly?
** DONE Example right after the introduction?
** DONE s/~/\:/
** DONE Footnote the address of the Agda model
** DONE Capitalized titles
** DONE titles are sometimes quite vague
** DONE Tech report as a bibtex entry, or footnote?

No tech report.


** DONE s/judgement/judgment/
** DONE Check argument order to substI
** DONE Brink back original ICFP template

Without the restored "onecolumn" mode.

** DONE Implicit underscored indexing
** DONE Uniformize names of function args
** DONE Check bibliography references
** DONE Look for inlining figures
** DONE SUBMIT THE B&W VERSION!
** DONE Fix every \note{} in the paper
** DONE Ispell
** DONE Check/fix alignment in code
** DONE Fix code overflows
** DONE Check coloring of terms
** DONE Precise that we are talking in the Evidence language

I guess that the point is the following: we are not talking about
higher-level presentation. So, we manipulate/make low-level terms and
people have to bear with that.

I don't know where to write this down.

** DONE Make a NAME version of constructors

And remove the \!


** DONE switchD elaboration rule is in a bad state
