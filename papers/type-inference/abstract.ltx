%%% 
We consider the problems of first-order unification and type inference
from a
%%% very
general perspective on problem-solving, namely 
that of information increase in the problem context. 
%%% 
This leads to a powerful technique for implementing
type inference algorithms. 
%%% 
We describe a unification algorithm and illustrate the technique
%% by describing an implementation of type inference for
%%% by applying it to
for
the familiar Hindley-Milner type system, 
but it can be applied to more advanced type systems.
%%%
The algorithms depend on
%%% a well-founded invariant on
\emph{well-founded} contexts:
%%% in which
type variable bindings and type-schemes for terms 
   may depend only on earlier bindings.
We ensure that 
   unification yields a most general unifier, 
and that 
   type inference yields principal types, 
by advancing definitions earlier in the context only when 
%%% absolutely
necessary.
